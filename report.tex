\begin{abstract}

The wavelet transforms of two similar signals show differences caused by discrete frequency changes in time.
Then, random noise on a linear function is filtered out and separately reconstructed.

\end{abstract}



\begin{Introduction}

The Fourier transform captures the frequency information of a signal, but loses time resolution.
To include time data in the analysis, the wavelet transform must be used.
